## üìù Important Notes

### Before Re-enabling Workflows:

The workflows contain **outdated folder names** and need to be updated:

#### Changes needed:
1. **Folder name**: `HealthGeneratorApp` ‚Üí `HealthKitDataGeneratorApp`
2. **Workspace**: `HealthGeneratorApp.xcworkspace` ‚Üí `HealthKitDataGeneratorApp.xcworkspace`
3. **Scheme**: `-scheme HealthGeneratorApp` ‚Üí `-scheme HealthKitDataGeneratorApp`

#### Files that need updates:
- `ci.yml` - Lines 68, 74, 84
- `codeql.yml` - Lines 45, 47
- `release.yml` - Lines 33, 39

## üîÑ To Re-enable Workflows:

### Option 1: Move files back (after updating)
```bash
# 1. Update the folder names in workflow files
# 2. Move back to workflows directory
mv .github/workflows.disabled/*.yml .github/workflows/
```

### Option 2: Rename directory
```bash
# After updating folder names in the files
mv .github/workflows.disabled .github/workflows
```

## üß™ Testing Workflows Locally

Before re-enabling, you can test workflows locally:

### Using `act`:
```bash
# Install act
brew install act

# Test CI workflow
act -j test-swift-package
act -j build-ios-app
act -j lint
```

### Manual testing:
```bash
# Test Swift Package
cd HealthKitDataGenerator && swift build && swift test

# Test iOS App
cd HealthKitDataGeneratorApp && tuist generate

# Run SwiftLint
swiftlint lint
```
